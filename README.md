# CS230
A collection of my work in SNHU's CS230

#Client and Software Requirements

The client, The Gaming Room, requested a multi-platform adaptation of their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, originally built for Android. The goal was to create a web-based, distributed version of the game that could operate seamlessly across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile devices. The software needed to support multiple teams, rounds of gameplay, and provide a scalable, server-based solution to handle thousands of simultaneous players.

#Strengths in Documentation Development

One area I excelled in was clearly documenting platform-specific considerations, outlining the pros and cons of each (Linux, Windows, macOS, and mobile) for both server-side and client-side functionality. By detailing the requirements of each platform, I provided a well-rounded evaluation that enabled The Gaming Room to make an informed decision.

#Value of the Design Document in Development

Working through the design document was helpful as it required me to break down complex requirements into clear, actionable components. This clarity allowed me to identify necessary development tools, security protocols, and performance considerations upfront. Additionally, it provided a structured approach to code development, which minimized rework.

#Opportunities for Revision

If I could revise one aspect, it would be the Storage and Memory Management section. While I provided a general overview, I would improve it by adding specific strategies for handling data efficiently in a distributed environment, such as caching or cloud storage options, to further optimize performance.

#Interpreting User Needs

I focused on understanding The Gaming Room’s need for scalability, multi-user support, and smooth gameplay across platforms. Translating these into design features such as serverless architecture and cross-platform development tools ensured the game would be accessible to a broad audience. Considering user needs is crucial, as it directly impacts user satisfaction and the application’s usability and longevity.

#Approach to Software Design

My approach involved modular design, starting with core requirements (such as platform compatibility and multi-user support) and then addressing specific features through techniques like microservices and cross-platform frameworks. In the future, I’d use strategies like prototyping to rapidly validate user requirements and obtain feedback. Additionally, I’d implement agile methodologies to iteratively improve the design and adapt to changing requirements.
